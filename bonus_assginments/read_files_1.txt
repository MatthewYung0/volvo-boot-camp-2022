Hello World. My name is Matthew.
This is a test file.
If there are duplicates, you will find it at the end of the file of read_files_2;
However, anything that are not words, such as . , [ _ will not be considered as a word, hence, omitted from the list.

For example, there should be 10 duplicates for the word snake. Check in the second file to confirm!
